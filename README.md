**Project Insights:**
The analysis revealed that most road accidents occurred in urban areas, with cars contributing to the highest number of casualties. Slight injuries were more common than serious or fatal ones. Accidents were found to increase during daylight and clear weather conditions, suggesting that high traffic volume plays a key role. Certain months showed a noticeable rise in total accidents, highlighting seasonal patterns and the need for increased safety measures during those periods.

**Final Conclusion:**
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard effectively provides a clear understanding of accident trends and risk factors. By identifying patterns based on vehicle type, location, and conditions, the dashboard supports authorities and policymakers in taking data-driven decisions to enhance road safety, reduce casualties, and promote responsible driving practices.
